EDIT Projeto 360 - ShopInPorto website

The scope of “360o Project” was to develop new ideas to potentiate a platform that displays the street commerce of Porto city, “Shop in Porto” focusing on the improvement of the UX.
My role on this project was to develop the front-end of the user journey using a JSON API.
With the technologies I’ve learned, I programmed the platform in mobile and desktop using Responsive Web development and Git for versions control.

Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, JSON API, Responsive web development
Tools: Git versions control, yarn
